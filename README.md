Description:  
  We primarily used R studio for our analysis of the data sets provided by the biology department. The raw data we used was provided as a .CSV and .XLSX file. Some visualizations were created in R studio to analzye data regarding Butterflies and Ladybugs. We wanted to see the wing length, wing width, and apex area by decade, grouped by sex for the butterflies data set. For the ladybugs data set, we wanted to see the count of species characterized by plot, we also saw who collected what species and we also wanted to see common species in IOWA and ILLINOIS. Data dictionary and visualizations are provided below:
  
Data Dictonary:

Cabbage Butterfly:
Core ID: Unique identification code assigned to each specie
RW length - measurements of the right wing from the top of right to the bottom
RW width - measurements of the  wing from where the wing meets the body to the edge
RW Apex A - peak point of the right wing
LW Length - measurements of the left wing from the top of left to the bottom
LW width - measurements of the left wing from where the wing meets the body to the edge 
LW Apex A - peak point of the left wing

Insect Carnivore:
